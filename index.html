        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>"You know, Im sick of following my dreams man. I'm just gonna ask them where they're going and hook up with 'em later."<br> -Mitch Hedberg<br>   -Tyler Harrison</p>

        <p>I have always wanted to learn more languages, and that's how I view coding. With have more experience using code than writing it, but so far this has been an exciting challange to overcome. Learning soemthing new everyday is essential to living, and I look forward to adding practical skills to my tool box from this class. </p>
